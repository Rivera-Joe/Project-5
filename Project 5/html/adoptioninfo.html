<h1 align="center">Thinking of Adopting?</h1>
<p>The Happy Tails Animal Shelter offers a safe haven to hundreds of lost, neglected and abandoned animals. We are working in partnership with the community to create a secure, healthy and caring environment for all the animals in our care.</p>
<p>Please see below for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. Contact us by phone at 281-999-9999 if you don’t find what you’re looking for.</p>
<h2>How do I adopt a pet?</h2>
<p>Simply come to the shelter during regular adoption hours and meet with one of our adoption counselors. All adopters must be 18 years old or above and adoptions must be done in person.</p>
<h2>Which animal should I choose?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are you looking for a quiet, laid-back lap cat or a “ready-to-play” dog?</li>
<li>Will your landscaping survive the natural digging behaviors of a lab puppy?</li>
<li>Does the dog or cat match your energy level?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an idea of what type of pet fits your lifestyle, stop in and speak with one of our pet adoption counselors. Adopting a pet is a serious, lifelong commitment and our experienced counselors will be happy to help you find and select the right pet for you.</p>
<p>You’ll be given the opportunity to observe, pet and play with your potentially new furry friend before making your decision.</p>
<h2>How do I prepare before I adopt?</h2>
<p>A few suggestions to help prepare for a new pet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure other pets you have are currently vaccinated before bringing home a new pet.</li>
<li>Find a veterinarian if you do not already have one.</li>
<li>Prepare other family members and discuss the responsibilities associated with having a new pet in the home. It's important that everyone be in agreement with the decision to adopt.</li>
<li>Evaluate your home and yard to be sure it is safe for your new pet. All dogs and cats in unincorporated Harris County are required by law to be confined in their own yard or on a leash at all times. When adopting a dog, check your fence to be sure it is secure enough to keep your new pet from escaping.</li>
<li>If you are adopting a cat, the safest place to keep them is inside the house. If allowed to roam, cats can be injured by loose dogs, hit by a car or exposed to diseases that could harm the cat and/or family members.
</ul>
<h2>What is included in the adoption and what is the process?</h2>
<p>Cats and dogs (both) are microchipped, dewormed, spayed or neutered and come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rabies vaccination and tag</li>
<li>A Harris County annual license tag</li>
<li>The medical history while in our care</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage everyone to bring their new pet, along with the medical history, to a veterinarian within three days for follow-up exams and vaccination boosters. You will be given a list of veterinarians that will perform the first exam free of charge.</p>
