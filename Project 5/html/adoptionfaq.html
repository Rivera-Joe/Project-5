    <h3>Adoption FAQ</h3>
  
    <dl>
      <dt>How do I adopt a pet?</dt>
      <dd>Simply come to the shelter during regular adoption hours and meet with one of our adoption counselors. All adopters must be 18 years old or above and adoptions must be done in person.
      </dd> 
  
      <dt>Which animal should I choose?</dt>
      <dd><ul>
          <li>Are you looking for a quiet, laid-back lap cat or a “ready-to-play” dog?</li>
          <li>Will your landscaping survive the natural digging behaviors of a lab puppy?</li>
          <li>Does the dog or cat match your energy level?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you have an idea of what type of pet fits your lifestyle, stop in and speak with one of our pet adoption counselors. Adopting a pet is a serious, lifelong commitment and our experienced counselors will be happy to help you find and select the right pet for you.</p>
          <p>You’ll be given the opportunity to observe, pet and play with your potentially new furry friend before making your decision.</p>
      </dd> 
  
      <dt>How do I prepare before I adopt?</dt>
      <dd><p>A few suggestions to help prepare for a new pet:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Be sure other pets you have are currently vaccinated before bringing home a new pet.</li>
        <li>Find a veterinarian if you do not already have one.</li>
        <li>Prepare other family members and discuss the responsibilities associated with having a new pet in the home. It's important that everyone be in agreement with the decision to adopt.</li>
        <li>Evaluate your home and yard to be sure it is safe for your new pet. All dogs and cats in unincorporated Harris County are required by law to be confined in their own yard or on a leash at all times. When adopting a dog, check your fence to be sure it is secure enough to keep your new pet from escaping.</li>
        <li>If you are adopting a cat, the safest place to keep them is inside the house. If allowed to roam, cats can be injured by loose dogs, hit by a car or exposed to diseases that could harm the cat and/or family members.
        </ul>
      </dd> 
  
      <dt>What is included in the adoption and what is the process?</dt>
      <dd>
          <p>Cats and dogs (both) are microchipped, dewormed, spayed or neutered and come with:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Rabies vaccination and tag</li>
          <li>A Harris County annual license tag</li>
          <li>The medical history while in our care</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We strongly encourage everyone to bring their new pet, along with the medical history, to a veterinarian within three days for follow-up exams and vaccination boosters. You will be given a list of veterinarians that will perform the first exam free of charge.<p>
      </dd> 
  
      <dt>What are the benefits of pet adoption?</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>You’re saving a life. Millions of healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home. When you adopt your pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.</li>
          <li>Many adoptable pets are already trained.</li>
          <li>When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament. You also already know their full grown size!</li>
          <li>An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs to help prepare the pet for a new home.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd> 

      <dt>What if my new pet doesn’t work out?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Both you and your new pet will need time to get better acquainted and adjust. For some pets the transition is quick and easy. Others may need more time and help from you to become a successful pet companion. Happy Tails offers a 60-day adjustment period within which you can evaluate the pet’s progress and your adoption decision. If you should determine you and the pet are not compatible, you may return the pet to Happy Tails and receive an adoption credit certificate that can be used toward the adoption of another animal or purchase of pet supplies. All returns are scheduled through our Pet Helpline.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>How long will the adoption process take?</dt>
      <dd><p>Plan to allow one to two hours to complete the adoption process. It may take longer depending on how many pets you wish to meet, your previous experience with pet care, and the number of other visitors at the shelter. Peak days for visitor traffic are Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, so please allow extra time if you plan to visit on those days.</p>

        <p>Adoptions can be processed up to 30 minutes before closing time. If you wish to adopt and it’s less than 30 minutes before closing, we can place the pet on hold for you to finish your visitation and/or finalize the adoption the following day.</p></dd>

    <dt>What kinds of pets are in shelter/rescue groups?</dt>
    <dd><p>There are all types of pets waiting for their forever homes. Did you know…</p>
        <ul>
        <li>25% of adoptable pets are purebreds.</li>
        <li>There are many puppies and kittens available for adoption.</li>
        <li>You can also adopt birds, horses, rabbits, and a variety of other small and furry pets.</li>
        <li>Most adoptable pets are happy, healthy, house-trained, high quality pets.</li>
      </ul>
